- **Speed Improvement:** Parallelize to achieve test set processing in <2 hours (currently 3 images/sec without parallelization hence taking 12 hours).
- **Prompt Improvement**
- **Model Change:** Best rn is Qwen-VL-7b. Consider LLaVA. Phi3, Phi3.5, Minicpm, Qwen-VL-2b used but deemed inadequate.
- **Tool Performance:** Tool calling time should be <0.5 seconds else don't do.
- **No Quantization**: If quantized then speed is higher but accuracy lower so think carefully.
- **MUST Requirement:** Need a model with effective spatial recognition performance.
- **New Approach:** Crop images using SAM/CLIP's spatial and contextual awareness, then use Vision Language Models (VLM) for processing.
